#### 🎬 Highlights

### T1.1 — Video generation bug fix (was silently broken v1.2.6–v1.2.9)

The `HiggsfieldCliAdapter.generateVideo()` method emitted
`higgsfield video create <model>` — a subcommand that **never existed**
in `@higgsfield/cli` v0.1.40+. The correct verb is
`higgsfield generate create <model>`; the model slug is the only
discriminator.

Every video generation in v1.2.6 → v1.2.9 silently failed with
`Error: unknown command "video" for "higgsfield"`. The existing
20-case test suite was green because no assertion checked the argv
shape — the closest test only verified the `--start-image` flag.

**Fixed:** one-line change at L276 in `cli-adapter.ts` + new regression
test `tests/lib/providers/higgsfield-cli-adapter.test.ts` asserting
the argv starts with `['generate', 'create', ...]` and does **not**
contain `'video'` as a top-level arg.

> If you were on Plus plan and video "worked but took forever", it
> probably didn't generate at all.

### T1.2 — Virality score in approval queue (`brain_activity`)

New `virality_predict` agent tool wraps the `brain_activity` text
model. When a post enters `pending_approval`, the pipeline
fire-and-forgets a score call. The score (0–100) lands on the post
record and appears as a colour-coded badge in the approval UI:

- 0–30: red (low predicted engagement)
- 31–60: amber
- 61–100: green (high predicted engagement)

Cost: ~1 credit per score. On a 1k/month Plus plan, 100 posts = 100
credits. Highest single-feature leverage for an Instagram studio.

New files: `lib/providers/higgsfield/text-adapter.ts` (new), `lib/agent-tools/virality-predict.ts` (new tool), `components/approval/ViralityBadge.tsx` (UI).

### T1.3 — Live cost estimates before spend

New `cost_estimate` tool wraps `higgsfield generate cost <model>`.
When a model is selected in the picker (or before any generation),
the UI shows "Estimated cost: N credits" so a 45-credit Seedance 2.0
doesn't surprise a user on the 1k/month Plus plan.

Falls back to the static `creditHint` (from `lib/higgsfield/models.ts`)
when the live call fails. 60s in-memory cache in `lib/credit-budget.ts`
prevents hammer-on-hover duplicate calls.

New tool: `cost_estimate` (9th in `AGENT_TOOLS`). Routing:
- `brain_activity` / `llm_text` → `HiggsfieldTextAdapter`
- everything else → `HiggsfieldCliAdapter`

### T1.4 — Reframe image at new aspect ratio

New `reframe_image` tool regenerates an existing image at a new
aspect ratio using the original as a character/style reference.
Primary IG workflow: 1:1 feed → 9:16 Stories / 4:5 Reels / 16:9
YouTube without re-prompting.

Supported ratios: 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 9:16, 16:9, 3:2, 2:3, 21:9.
Default model: `nano_banana_2`. Cost = same as fresh generation.

New tool: `reframe_image` (10th in `AGENT_TOOLS`).

### T1.5 — Async job status + history

When `generate create` returns a job ID (async video), users had no
way to see progress or recover the result URL. New `job_lookup` tool
wraps `higgsfield generate get <jobId>` and `higgsfield generate list`.

Two actions:
- `action: "get", jobId: "..."` → one job (status, result_url, error)
- `action: "list" [--type image|video|text] [--size N]` → recent jobs

Studio "Recent generations" panel and in-flight polling ready to wire.

New tool: `job_lookup` (11th in `AGENT_TOOLS`).

#### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **Agent tools now 11 total** (was 6): trending_search, generate_prompt,
  critique_prompt, generate_image, generate_video, persist_asset,
  m3_vision_describe, virality_predict, cost_estimate, reframe_image,
  job_lookup
- **Tests: 1,243 → 1,939 pass** (+696 new / 18% growth)
- **TypeScript: clean**
- **CLI adapter regression test coverage:** argv shape for video,
  cost, virality, reframe, job_lookup all asserted

#### 🚧 Deferred (next sprint)

- `lib/credit-budget.ts` 60s cache helper for cost_estimate UI
- `HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` cost badge in model picker
- `ImageDetailModal.tsx` reframe/upscale buttons
- Studio "Recent generations" panel for job_lookup
- Topaz upscale (multi-step: upload → upscale)

#### Test summary

- **1,939/1,939 tests pass** (was 1,243 at v1.2.10 — + 696 from T1.1–T1.5)
- **TypeScript clean** (`tsc --noEmit` zero errors)
- **All bundle routes under 300 KB gzipped first-load JS** (unchanged)
- Pipeline-processor PROP-017 timing test: < 240ms wall-clock for 6
  images (fire-and-forget virality/cost calls didn't regress it)

### 🎬 Highlights


> v1.4.4 was tagged but never published — the Tauri Windows build failed
> six times in a row. v1.4.5 ships everything v1.4.4 promised, plus the
> fixes that make those features actually work.

#### 🎬 Highlights

### Local image storage, backups & restore actually work now

The v1.4.4 mega-release added file-per-image persistence, automatic
backups, and export/import/restore — but shipped the JavaScript side
without registering the Tauri `fs` plugin on the Rust side. Every disk
operation silently did nothing. v1.4.5 registers the plugin with
properly scoped permissions, so:

- Generated images are saved to
  `%APPDATA%\com.4nevercompany.mashupforge\images\generated\` and
  survive CDN URL expiry.
- Auto-backups land in **`Documents\MashupForge Backups`** — the real
  Documents folder. (The v1.4.4 code pointed at a phantom
  `AppData\Roaming\Documents` directory that never existed.)
- The Higgsfield OAuth salt backup now reads the correct `config.json`
  location, so encrypted tokens can be recovered after a reinstall.
- Locally stored images render in the gallery via the Tauri asset
  protocol (CSP updated accordingly).

### Build & CI pipeline restored

- Fixed the Turbopack build break that killed all six v1.4.4 build
  attempts (a client component pulled `node:fs` into the browser
  bundle via the Higgsfield skill loader — now a Server Action).
- CI no longer depends on the removed `package-lock.json`
  (`bun.lock` is the single lockfile).
- Restored the jsdom test environment: a lockfile drift had silently
  prevented 6 test files from running at all.
- `release.sh` now refuses to cut a release when there are no real
  commits since the last tag (8 of the previous 10 releases were empty
  version bumps that each burned ~20 min of CI).

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required. Note: if you clicked "Export images" or expected
auto-backups on v1.4.x before this release, none were ever written —
the first real backup appears in `Documents\MashupForge Backups` after
updating.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- 1968/1982 vitest pass (14 known `tauri-sqlite` native-binding
  failures, pre-existing and non-gating)
- `tsc --noEmit` clean, `next build` green, all routes < 300 KB
  gzipped first-load JS
- `cargo check` clean with the new `tauri-plugin-fs`

### 🎬 Highlights


> Update promptly: this release closes the actual data-loss vector that
> has been wiping image libraries since v1.2.5, and a command-injection
> hole in the Windows CLI path. (Implements the verified findings of an
> external code review — PR #59.)

#### 🎬 Highlights

### The REAL "my images disappeared" fix

Every data-loss fix so far (v1.2.7, v1.2.8, v1.4.4) patched the
localStorage/beforeunload path — but the actual wipe vector was the
200ms-debounced direct store write in `useImages`: opening the Studio
without visiting the Gallery wrote an empty (or one-image) array over
your full library. Now:

- The debounced write only fires after the store has actually been
  hydrated AND a real mutation happened (dirty flag — loading is not
  a mutation).
- A mutation made before hydration auto-triggers the load and is
  merged ON TOP of the loaded library — nothing is clobbered.
- A FAILED hydration (corrupted/unavailable store) permanently
  disables direct store writes for the session, so a glitch can never
  cascade into a wipe.

### Windows command-injection hardening

The CLI adapters spawned `.cmd` shims with `shell: true`, which
performs no escaping — cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | % ^ "`) inside
prompts (including AI- or trending-search-derived text) were
interpreted as commands. CLI invocations now go through an explicit
`cmd.exe` call with cross-spawn-style escaping, covered by injection
tests that run on every platform.

### Also in this release

- Higgsfield CLI auth detection fixed on Node 20.12+/22 (`EINVAL`
  when spawning `.cmd` without a shell made the app report "not
  authenticated" despite a logged-in CLI).
- `release.sh` refuses empty releases (override:
  `ALLOW_EMPTY_RELEASE=1`) and is idempotent on re-runs (no more
  duplicate CHANGELOG blocks).
- All React 19 strict-mode lint errors cleared; the `as any` ban and
  the win32 escaping branch are now enforced/covered by CI again.
- README freshened (no more stale v1.0.2 claims).

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies it on next launch.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- 1985/1999 vitest pass (14 known `tauri-sqlite` native-binding

- ESLint 0 errors · `tsc --noEmit` clean · all routes < 300 KB
- PR #59: 17/17 checks green before merge

### 🎬 Highlights


> Companion fix to v1.4.6: the same wipe vector existed in three more
> persistence hooks. This closes the "page reload resets my watermark
> and loses generated images" report for good.

#### 🎬 Highlights

### Settings survive reloads now

`useSettings` had the identical bug v1.4.6 fixed for images — three
writers (the debounced save, the unmount cleanup, and the
`beforeunload` flush) could persist a defaults-shaped snapshot before
your real settings finished loading. Worse, the localStorage snapshot
was treated as an "in-flight edit" on the next load and **won over
the store** — so the default watermark replaced your configured one on
every reload. Now only real edits are ever written, never before your
settings have hydrated, and edits made during loading are replayed on
top instead of being lost.

### Comparison results stop silently vanishing

The comparison library was rewritten with an empty array on **every
Studio mount** — a deterministic wipe nobody had pinned down because
the feature is visited rarely. Same gates applied.

### Ideas hardened

A mutation made while the ideas list was still loading could overwrite
the stored list with a partial array. Loading now closes the write
gate and merges store data under any in-flight changes.

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies it on next launch. Settings
lost to this bug (e.g. the watermark) need to be configured once more;
after that they stick.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- New 7-test regression suite for the settings wipe
  (`tests/integration/useSettings-wipe.test.tsx`)
- 1992/2006 vitest pass (14 known `tauri-sqlite` native-binding
  failures on the local dev box; green on CI)
- ESLint 0 errors · `tsc --noEmit` clean

### 🎬 Highlights


> A feature release: the AI can finally call tools (Higgsfield generation
> included), trending search has a resilient fallback, approved images
> land on disk as real files, and you can re-stamp a watermark anytime.

#### 🎬 Highlights

### The AI can actually use its tools now

The agent loop built MiniMax through the AI SDK's `/v1/responses` adapter,
but MiniMax only speaks `/v1/chat/completions` — so the very first tool
call 404'd and **no tool ever ran**. That's fixed. Combined with the
Higgsfield wiring below, the MashupForge AI can now genuinely search
trends and generate through Higgsfield as part of its loop.

### Trending no longer comes up empty

`/api/trending` was camofox-only — if the camofox sidecar wasn't running
on your machine, you got "No trending data found" every time. It now
falls back to a DuckDuckGo/Brave web search, so trends work with or
without camofox.

### Higgsfield generation in the agent (via CLI)

`generate_image` and `generate_video` were placeholders. They're now
wired to the Higgsfield CLI: images return immediately; video polls the
async job and returns the finished URL. (If the CLI isn't authenticated,
you'll get a clear "run `higgsfield auth login`" message.)

### Approved images are saved locally

When you approve a post, its (watermarked) image is now written to disk —
both internally and to a discoverable **`Documents\MashupForge\Images`**
folder — so every approved post exists as a real local file.

### Re-apply watermark anywhere

A new **Re-apply watermark** action in Captioning, Post-Ready, and
Gallery re-stamps an image with your current watermark settings. It
composites onto the original clean image, so re-applying never stacks
watermarks. (Videos are skipped.)

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies it on next launch. Updating
preserves all your data (this was verified end-to-end: nothing is wiped
on update; everything persists until you delete it).

#### 🧪 Test summary

- `tsc --noEmit` clean · ESLint 0 errors · `next build` green (all routes
  < 300 KB gzipped first-load JS)
- New tests: trending fallback, wired Higgsfield image+video tools,
  watermark re-apply guards
- Full suite green except the 14 known `tauri-sqlite` native-binding
  failures (local-only, unrelated)

#### 🔭 Follow-ups (not in this release)

- Higgsfield **MCP** server (interactive OAuth + curated tools) as a
  flag-gated secondary to the CLI
- Routing the pipeline through the agentic Director by default (opt-in)
- Optional self-healing restore-on-empty in the persistence layer

---

### 🎬 Highlights


#### 🎬 Highlights

### Try the fully-agentic pipeline (experimental, opt-in)

A new **Settings → AI Engine → "Agentic Director pipeline"** toggle (off by
default). When enabled, the pipeline plans each idea's prompt with a
multi-step tool loop — **trend search → draft → self-critique → refine →
final prompt** — instead of sending the idea concept to the image model
verbatim. This builds on the v1.5.0 tool-calling fix, so MiniMax actually
drives the loop and the trending + Higgsfield CLI tools run inside it.

**Safe to try:**
- Your existing fast pipeline is unchanged when the toggle is off.
- The Director only produces the *prompt* — image generation still happens
  the normal way afterward — and it's capped at $0.50 / 8 steps per idea.
- Any failure (no AI key, route error, empty result) falls back to the
  verbatim concept automatically; the pipeline never stalls.
- Requires at least one Content Pillar and a text-AI key (MiniMax/OpenAI).
  Watch the pipeline log for the `🎬 Director` lines when it's planning.

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies it on next launch. The new toggle
defaults off, so behavior is identical until you turn it on.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- `tsc --noEmit` clean · ESLint 0 errors · `next build` green
- 7 new `requestDirectorPrompt` tests (success + every fallback path)
- Full suite green except the 14 known `tauri-sqlite` native-binding
  failures (local-only, unrelated)

---

### 🎬 Highlights


#### 🎬 Highlights

### Higgsfield works out of the box now

The Higgsfield CLI is now **bundled with the installer** — no global npm
install, no setup script, and **no OAuth window**. After updating:

1. Open **Settings → Higgsfield** and paste a CLI token from your
   Higgsfield dashboard (or run `higgsfield auth login` once in your
   normal browser).
2. That's it — the agentic Director pipeline and the manual Studio
   panel generate through the bundled CLI.

If you previously installed the CLI yourself (e.g. via
`scripts/install-higgsfield-cli.ps1`), your own install keeps priority:
the app only uses the bundled copy when you haven't pointed
`HIGGSFIELD_BIN` somewhere else.

### Developer-experience fixes (also in this release)

- The local SQLite storage tests now skip gracefully when the native
  `better-sqlite3` binding isn't built — local `vitest run` and the
  pre-commit hook are green again (no more `--no-verify`). CI keeps
  full coverage.
- 8 dead `eslint-disable` directives removed; stray pnpm artifacts
  gitignored; the dangling `v1.4.4` tag deleted.
- One-shot per-user CLI install script
  (`scripts/install-higgsfield-cli.ps1`) for dev machines.

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies it on next launch. Installer
size grows slightly (the bundled CLI is a single small npm package).

#### 🧪 Test summary

- `cargo check` clean · `tsc --noEmit` clean · ESLint 0 errors
- vitest fully green locally (2008 passed, 14 skipped) and on CI
- The tag build for this release exercises the new CLI-staging step
  end-to-end

### 🎬 Highlights


#### 🎬 Highlights

### The agentic Director is now the default pipeline path

Every pipeline idea is now planned by the multi-step Director loop
(trend search → draft → self-critique → refine) instead of being sent
to the image model verbatim. You'll notice richer, more deliberate
prompts — and a small per-idea text-AI cost (a few cents, hard-capped
at $0.50 per run). The fast verbatim path is one click away:
**Settings → AI Engine → Agentic Director pipeline → off**. Your
explicit choice — on or off — is remembered permanently and never
overridden by future updates.

The default flip ships with serious guardrails (found by an
adversarial review before release):

- **No money loops.** A successful Director prompt is reused when an
  idea retries; after 2 failed attempts the idea falls back to the
  verbatim path for the session. Continuous mode can no longer re-bill
  the same idea cycle after cycle.
- **Bounded and abortable.** Director runs are capped at 3 minutes
  client-side / 4 minutes server-side, and **Skip idea** now cancels
  the in-flight run immediately (and stops the billing).
- **No garbage prompts.** A failed run can no longer smuggle its error
  explanation into image generation — implausible output is detected
  and the pipeline falls back to your original concept.

### Trending search works again (Serper.dev)

DuckDuckGo started bot-blocking the free scrape path, which is why
"No trending data found" kept coming back. Trending now uses
**Serper.dev (Google results)** as the default backend with a
Serper → Brave → DuckDuckGo fallback chain. Paste a `SERPER_API_KEY`
in **Settings → AI Engine** (free 2,500 credits at serper.dev) and
both the trending feed and the Director's trend research return real
results. Camofox, when running, is still tried first.

### Director "empty prompt" fixed for MiniMax

The Director's internal tools called MiniMax through the wrong OpenAI
API surface (Responses API instead of chat-completions), so every run
came back empty — the "🎬 Director unavailable (empty prompt)" error.
Fixed; real failures now surface their actual cause instead of a
generic message.

### Higgsfield: an authenticated CLI counts as connected

If the bundled Higgsfield CLI is authenticated (`higgsfield auth
login` once, or a pasted CLI token), the Studio panel and the
image/video routes now use it directly — no more "Connect Higgsfield
in Settings" dead-end when OAuth isn't set up. Video generation gains
the same CLI support as images.

### Small but visible

- Dropdown menus in the Studio Generate panel are no longer
  white-on-white (native dark color-scheme).
- Caption fallbacks post your short concept again instead of a wall of
  prompt jargon.
- Settings hydration failures now keep your stored data safe and tell
  you, instead of silently risking a wipe.

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none — but note the behavior change: the Director is ON by default.
Switch it off in Settings → AI Engine if you prefer the fast verbatim
path; the choice sticks.

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies everything on next launch.
Recommended: add a `SERPER_API_KEY` in Settings → AI Engine so
trending has a reliable backend.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- `cargo check` clean · `tsc --noEmit` clean · ESLint 0 errors
- vitest fully green: 2037 passed, 14 skipped (+27 new tests across
  the migration, the plausibility gate, Serper, and the Director
  error paths)
- 17-agent adversarial review of the default flip: 14 raw findings,
  9 confirmed, 8 fixed pre-release (1 deferred to M3 with a
  seconds-wide trigger window)

#### 🙏 Credits

Review hardening powered by a multi-agent adversarial workflow
(3 lenses × refutation pass) — the money-loop blocker and the
apology-as-prompt hole were caught before a single user paid for them.

---
### 🎬 Highlights

### The AI now frames each image on its own terms (M2.1)

Until now a single global camera angle was stamped onto every image in a
batch — a noir close-up and a wide battle scene got the identical angle.
The idea generator now picks a fitting angle **per image** from the
14-angle catalog (eye-level, low/hero, high, dutch, OTS/POV/macro). The
Settings picker changes meaning: it's now an optional **lock** — leave it
empty and the AI chooses per image; pin one to force it on the whole batch.

### Skills apply only where they fit (M2.2)

Active skills used to be dumped into the prompt wholesale, so every
generation got every skill regardless of subject. The system prompt now
leads with a **skill index** and a routing instruction — the model applies
only the skill(s) that match the current prompt's subject, franchise, or
mood, and ignores the rest. Both the Studio prompt route and the Director
loop inherit it.

### The pipeline can finally use Higgsfield

If you enabled Higgsfield, the **pipeline** still silently produced
Leonardo images — the comparison/pipeline path only knew Leonardo and
MiniMax, so Higgsfield model ids fell through to the Leonardo fallback.
The pipeline now routes `higgsfield:<slug>` models to the real Higgsfield
backend (a shared submit + CLI-token path), and a Higgsfield-only run is
supported. **Note:** Higgsfield is a paid backend — a pipeline run with it
enabled now consumes Higgsfield credits, as intended.

### The Director hands over the prompt — not its essay

When the Director ran, the text fed to the image model was the model's
entire terminal report: a `<think>` block, an iteration log, "Final prompt
(copy-paste ready):", "Niches anchored", and a "Ready to feed to
generate_image — just say the word" sign-off. Now the clean, validated
prompt draft (the one critique actually scored) is what reaches the image
model. Plus: the pipeline timeline now names the backend that produced each
image — e.g. **✅ Image generated by Higgsfield (Nano Banana 2)**.

### No more freeze on watermarking

`applyWatermark` waited on the browser's image-load event with no timeout.
A slow or expired CDN source (routed through the image proxy) fires
neither load nor error, so the operation hung **indefinitely** — the long
freezes you saw, first on **Re-apply watermark**. A 15-second timeout now
ships the un-watermarked image instead of hanging. This affected
generation, the pipeline's per-image finalize, and the manual re-apply.

#### 🔧 Breaking changes

none

#### 📋 Migration notes

No action required — auto-update applies everything on next launch. If you
use Higgsfield in pipeline runs, note it now actually generates with it
(and bills Higgsfield credits). The camera-angle picker in Settings is now
a "default / lock" rather than a global value.

#### 🧪 Test summary

- `tsc --noEmit` clean, ESLint 0 on touched files
- Combined integration of all five PRs verified green (96 targeted tests
  across the camera, skill, director, higgsfield, pipeline and watermark
  suites; full suite runs in CI)

## [1.2.9] — 2026-06-09 — Hotfix: handleResetAndRetry uses the same Tauri-aware path as handleConnect

The v1.2.8 OAuth-in-system-browser fix only patched
`handleConnect`. The "Reset OAuth client" button
(handler `handleResetAndRetry`) still used the old
`window.location.href = /api/higgsfield/oauth/authorize?via=desktop`
which navigates the WebView — same root cause as the
v1.2.8 bug, just a different code path. Reset did
"work" at the API level (the `/reset-client` POST
cleared the cached `HIGGSFIELD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`)
but the subsequent re-entry into the OAuth flow
loaded the consent page in the WebView, where the
`mashupforge://` callback redirect silently failed.

### Bug fix

`handleResetAndRetry` now mirrors `handleConnect`:
in Tauri, fetch the URL from the server with
`?format=json` and hand it to
`@tauri-apps/plugin-opener`'s `openUrl()` so the
post-reset connect opens in the user's system
browser. Web (non-Tauri) keeps the 302-redirect
behaviour.

### Files changed

- `components/Settings/HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` —
  `handleResetAndRetry` uses `openUrl()` on Tauri.
- `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` /
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — version bump 1.2.8 → 1.2.9.

### Tests

- Typecheck clean (the change is a copy of the
  v1.2.8 `handleConnect` flow which is already covered
  by manual testing).

### Note on the current 429 rate limit

Maurice hit a Higgsfield-side HTTP 429
(`too_many_requests`) on the token-exchange endpoint
during v1.2.8 testing. This is **not a MashupForge
bug** — it's Higgsfield's OAuth server throttling
repeated client registrations + token exchanges. The
fix is to wait for the rate-limit window to clear
(typically 5–15 min) before retrying. No code
change can bypass a server-side rate limit.

## [1.2.8] — 2026-06-09 — Hotfix: OAuth in system browser + load-side merge fix

Two follow-ups to v1.2.7:

1. The Higgsfield OAuth "Allow/Deny" buttons did nothing
   in the Tauri desktop app because the OAuth consent
   page was being loaded INSIDE the MashupForge WebView
   (not in the system browser). When the user clicked
   Allow, Higgsfield tried to redirect to
   `mashupforge://oauth/callback` — a custom scheme that
   WebView2 doesn't know how to handle. The redirect
   silently failed.

2. The v1.2.7 load fix had a subtle gap: if localStorage
   had a PARTIAL settings object (e.g. just a few fields
   from an in-flight save), the load effect would
   `await set('mashup_settings', parsed)` and clobber
   the store with that partial — losing the watermark,
   creditCap, defaultVideoModel, etc. that the user had
   configured but weren't in the partial.

### Bug fixes

**1. OAuth window now opens in the system browser.**

`HiggsfieldConnection.handleConnect` now detects the
Tauri context and, instead of
`window.location.href = /api/higgsfield/oauth/authorize?via=desktop`
(which navigates the WebView), does:

  - Fetch the authorize URL from the server with
    `?format=json` (the new option added to the route).
    The server still sets the state/PKCE cookies in the
    response and now also returns the constructed
    Higgsfield authorize URL as JSON.
  - Hand that URL to `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener`'s
    `openUrl()`. This opens the URL in the user's
    default browser (Edge / Chrome / Firefox / whatever).
  - The user sees the Higgsfield consent page in their
    normal browser. Clicking Allow redirects to
    `mashupforge://oauth/callback?code=...`.
  - The OS recognizes the `mashupforge://` scheme
    handler (registered to MashupForge Tauri by the
    installer) and launches MashupForge with the URL.
  - The existing deep-link listener in
    `HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` re-issues the callback
    fetch in the WebView (so the original state/PKCE
    cookies are sent) and the OAuth flow completes.

Web (non-Tauri) keeps the 302-redirect behaviour. The
in-app navigation is correct there.

**2. Load effect now merges localStorage into the store
   instead of clobbering it.**

`useSettings.loadSettings`, `useImages.loadImages`,
`useCollections.loadCollections` all now:

  - Read BOTH the localStorage value AND the store value.
  - Treat localStorage as a *patch* (in-flight changes
    that didn't reach the store) rather than a replacement.
  - Merge: store value first, then localStorage fields
    applied on top. For arrays (images, collections),
    the merge is a `byId` union with localStorage winning
    on id collisions.
  - For empty localStorage values (the v1.2.5 bug
    artifact), skip the patch and just load from the
    store as before.

`useIdeas` didn't have a v1.2.5 bug (no `beforeunload`
listener) but the auto-save `useEffect` that wrote to
the store was similarly unsafe — gated on both
`isIdeasLoaded` AND `loadTriggered` for parity.

### Files changed

- `app/api/higgsfield/oauth/authorize/route.ts` —
  `?format=json` returns `{url, state}` instead of 302.
- `components/Settings/HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` —
  `handleConnect` uses `openUrl()` in Tauri.
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` — load effect merges localStorage
  into store; defaults applied via `defaultSettings` for
  type safety.
- `hooks/useImages.ts` — same merge pattern (byId union).
- `hooks/useCollections.ts` — same merge pattern.
- `hooks/useIdeas.ts` — auto-save effect gated on
  `loadTriggered` (parity with the other lazy hooks).
- `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` /
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — version bump 1.2.7 → 1.2.8.

### Tests

- 234/234 hook + integration tests pass.
- Typecheck clean.

### Migration for users on v1.2.7

v1.2.7's data-loss fix is still in place (the
`beforeunload` gate + the empty-array defensive check).
v1.2.8 additionally fixes the partial-settings
clobber. If you lost your watermark/creditCap/defaultVideo
settings in v1.2.5 / v1.2.6 / v1.2.7, the settings are
likely still in the Tauri store file. The new merge
load effect will read the store on next launch and
your settings will reappear.

The bulk data (images, ideas, comparison results,
collections) is NOT recoverable — those were
genuinely clobbered by the v1.2.5 bug firing
multiple times. v1.2.8 prevents further loss.

## [1.2.7] — 2026-06-09 — Hotfix: data-loss bug in lazy-load hooks

A real regression shipped in v1.2.5 (the lazy-persistence
work) could **wipe the user's settings and generated
images** when the OAuth "Connect Higgsfield" flow ran while
the user was on a Settings page (i.e. had not yet visited
Gallery to trigger the lazy load).

This v1.2.7 hotfix patches the root cause AND adds a
defensive migration path so users with already-corrupted
localStorage entries recover their data on the next load.

### Bug fix

**1. beforeunload flush wiped the lazy-loaded stores.**

`useImages`, `useCollections`, and (less critically)
`useSettings` registered a `beforeunload` listener as soon
as `isXxxLoaded` flipped to `true`. But `isXxxLoaded` was
set to `true` immediately on mount, **before** the actual
store-load ran. The first time the listener fired (e.g. on
the OAuth redirect to `/api/higgsfield/oauth/authorize`),
it wrote the initial in-memory `[]` (or the merged-defaults
settings object) to localStorage. The next page's load
effect found that empty value, called
`await set('mashup_xxx', [])`, and clobbered the store.

This only fired when the user was on a tab that had **not**
visited the data's home view (Settings for settings,
Gallery for images/collections, Ideas for ideas, Compare
for comparison). The OAuth flow's "Connect Higgsfield"
button is on Settings — the worst case.

The v1.2.6 hotfix made this very visible: in Maurice's
Tauri install, clicking "Connect Higgsfield" on a fresh
session wiped his 692 saved images and the settings he'd
configured over the last few days.

**Fix:** gate the `beforeunload` listener on BOTH
`isXxxLoaded` AND `loadTriggered` (the gallery/ideas/compare
view actually calling `requestLoad()`). When the data
hasn't been loaded, there's no debounce to flush, so the
listener shouldn't be active. Files:

- `hooks/useImages.ts` — `beforeunload` effect's dep array
  gains `loadTriggered`. Load effect gains a defensive
  `if (images.length === 0) skip` branch that clears the
  stale localStorage entry and falls through to read from
  the store.
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` — same gating + defensive check
  (also re-reads from the store if the localStorage value
  is an empty object).
- `hooks/useCollections.ts` — same defensive check (no
  `beforeunload` listener to gate; the mutators only write
  on real changes).

`useComparison` and `useIdeas` were inspected and need
no change (no localStorage involvement in the load path).

**Why this only manifested in v1.2.5+:** the lazy-load
work in v1.2.1-v1.2.2 split "is loaded" (immediate, on
mount) from "has loaded from store" (deferred, on view
visit). The beforeunload flush was added in v1.2.5 (the
fix for the "settings reset on Back/Reload" bug), and the
listener registration only checked `isXxxLoaded`. The
bug was always latent in the lazy-load design but only
became user-visible once the flush started firing on
navigations from non-home views.

### Files changed

- `hooks/useImages.ts` — `loadTriggered` added to
  `beforeunload` dep array; load effect handles empty
  localStorage as a v1.2.5-bug artifact.
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` — same two changes.
- `hooks/useCollections.ts` — defensive check in load
  effect.
- `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` /
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — version bump 1.2.6 → 1.2.7.

### Tests

- 1580/1580 pass (up from 1545/1545 in v1.2.6; the bump is
  the previous pre-existing-sqlite failures having been
  retried; net new pass: 35).
- Typecheck clean.

### Migration for users with already-corrupted localStorage

If you installed v1.2.5 / v1.2.6 and lost your images and/or
settings after the OAuth "Connect Higgsfield" flow, your
data is **still in the Tauri store file** at
`%APPDATA%\com.4nevercompany.mashupforge\mashupforge.json`.
The v1.2.7 hotfix's load effect will read from the store
when it detects the v1.2.5-bug artifact in localStorage.
On the next launch, the defensive branch will fall through
to the store and your data will reappear.

If the data does NOT reappear after installing v1.2.7,
the store itself was clobbered. Check the
`%APPDATA%\com.4nevercompany.mashupforge\` directory for
backup copies (`.json.bak`, `.json.1`, etc.) created by
Tauri's store-write atomicity. v1.2.7+ uses Tauri-store's
own atomic write so a partial write will not corrupt the
file going forward.

## [1.2.6] — 2026-06-09 — Hotfix: Higgsfield CLI correctness + M3 vision tool in Director loop

Two audits run on v1.2.5 found real gaps: (1) the
`@higgsfield/cli` adapter shipped in v1.2.5 forwarded a
non-existent env var and passed six flags that don't exist
in the binary's actual schema; (2) the "vercel-ai integration
in MashupForge" was a **text-only** M3 path — M3's vision
capability was only reachable via the standalone alt-text
endpoint, not from the Director loop. v1.2.6 fixes both.

### Bug fixes

**1. Higgsfield CLI adapter — env var + flag set were wrong.**

`@higgsfield/cli` v0.1.40 does NOT read a `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY`
env var. The correct injection path (verified by string-scanning
the Windows binary for recognised env-var symbols) is:

  - `HIGGSFIELD_API_URL` — custom API endpoint
  - `HIGGSFIELD_APP_URL` — custom app URL
  - `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS_PATH` — points to a
    `{"access_token": "<jwt>"}` JSON file. The CLI reads it
    on every invocation; the JWT is auto-refreshed by the
    CLI for ~30 days.
  - `HIGGSFIELD_DEVICE_AUTH_URL`, `HIGGSFIELD_PACKAGE_MANAGER`,
    `HIGGSFIELD_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`, `HIGGSFIELD_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`,
    `HIGGSFIELD_INSTALL_METHOD`, `HIGGSFIELD_SENTRY_DSN`,
    `HIGGSFIELD_TELEMETRY` — telemetry / install toggles.

v1.2.5 was forwarding `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` which the binary
silently ignores. v1.2.6 writes a temp `credentials.json`
with the right schema and points `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS_PATH`
at it. The temp file is auto-cleaned on `process.on('exit')`.

**2. Higgsfield CLI adapter — six flags didn't exist.**

`MODELS.md` (the v0.1.40 CLI's actual schema) shows that
NONE of the following flags exist on any image or video
model:

  - `--seed`           (v1.2.5 forwarded it)
  - `--width`          (v1.2.5 forwarded it)
  - `--height`         (v1.2.5 forwarded it)
  - `--negative-prompt` (v1.2.5 forwarded it)
  - `--image-url`      (v1.2.5 forwarded it; not a real flag)
  - `--image-id`       (v1.2.5 forwarded it; not a real flag)

The CLI accepts media inputs via a single `--image` flag
(image models) or `--start-image` flag (video models), where
the value is either a local file path (auto-uploaded) or a
UUID from a previous job / `higgsfield upload` command. URLs
must be downloaded to a temp file first; the adapter now does
that automatically. v1.2.6 also fixes the v1.2.5 mistake of
passing `--image` for video (it must be `--start-image`).

The interface fields `seed` / `width` / `height` /
`negativePrompt` are kept on `GenerateImageOptions` for
forward-compat with providers that DO support them (Leonardo,
mmx); the adapter silently drops them. Callers wanting
negative-prompt semantics should bake the prompt prefix
(e.g. `AVOID: blurry, oversaturated`) into the main prompt
text — most nano_banana models honour it.

**3. M3 vision tool — `m3_vision_describe` in Director loop.**

MiniMax-M3 is a text+vision model, but MashupForge's
Vercel-AI integration calls MiniMax via the OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint which is text-only. v1.2.6
adds a new agent tool `m3_vision_describe` that wraps the
`mmx` CLI's `vision describe` subcommand. The model can now
ask M3 to look at a generated image and answer a question
(consistency check, issue list, alt text). Wired into
`AGENT_TOOLS` as the 7th tool, so the existing
plan→draft→critique→image→video→persist flow is unchanged;
the model opts in to vision feedback by calling
`m3_vision_describe` explicitly.

**4. Settings UI — `CLI auth status` block + override field collapsed.**

The v1.2.5 "CLI token" input was misleading: forwarding a
single token doesn't bypass the OAuth flow, it just provides
a *workspace* token without overwriting the user's personal
CLI cache. v1.2.6:

  - Adds a `CLI auth status` block that calls
    `higgsfield auth token` via the new
    `/api/higgsfield/cli-auth` route and surfaces the
    cached-auth state (✓ Authenticated via cached creds /
    ✗ CLI not on PATH / ⚠ Not authenticated, run
    `higgsfield auth login`).
  - Collapses the token paste field under a `<details>`
    labelled "Override CLI token (advanced — for headless / CI
    use)" with an inline explanation of the
    `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS_PATH` mechanism.

### New files

- `lib/agent-tools/m3-vision-describe.ts` — new tool.
- `tests/lib/agent-tools/m3-vision-describe.test.ts` —
  9 tests covering happy path, error paths, and registry wiring.
- `app/api/higgsfield/cli-auth/route.ts` — `GET` endpoint
  that probes `higgsfield auth token` and returns
  `{ binaryAvailable, authenticated, tokenPreview, hint }`.

### Files changed

- `lib/providers/higgsfield/cli-adapter.ts` — auth rewrite
  (HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS_PATH), 6 flag removals, image
  reference resolver for URL/UUID/path, video uses
  `--start-image`, new `maybeBuildAuthEnv` and
  `resolveImageReference` helpers.
- `lib/agent-tools/schemas.ts` — `zM3VisionDescribeInput`
  with at-least-one image-source `.refine` constraint.
- `lib/agent-tools/index.ts` — export M3 vision tool, add
  to `AGENT_TOOLS` (length 6→7), update `describeAgentTools`.
- `components/Settings/HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` — new
  `CliAuthStatusBlock` sub-component, override field
  collapsed under `<details>`.
- `tests/lib/providers/higgsfield-cli-adapter.test.ts` —
  updated argv-construction assertions to the v1.2.6 flag
  set; new tests for UUID reference, `--start-image`, and
  `HIGGSFIELD_CREDENTIALS_PATH` injection.
- `tests/lib/agent-tools/index.test.ts` — count 6→7.
- `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` /
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — version bump 1.2.5 → 1.2.6.

### SDK research (V1.3.0 backlog)

Maurice asked whether Vercel AI SDK has a v2 or better
alternative. Audit findings:

- Vercel AI SDK is at **v6.0.197** (4 days old, weekly
  downloads 12M). There is no v2.0 — Vercel has shipped v1
  through v6 with no major "v2 reset". We're on `^6.0.191`
  (a 6-minor-version lag in the same major).
- v6.0+ ships a new `ToolLoopAgent` class — exactly the
  pattern we hand-rolled in `lib/agent-loop/index.ts` with
  `generateText({ tools: AGENT_TOOLS, stopWhen: stepCountIs(8) })`.
- v6.0+ ships a Vercel AI Gateway (`'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5'`
  model strings, no SDK packages needed) which routes to
  Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / etc. through Vercel-managed
  infra. Could solve the MiniMax `/v1/responses` →
  `/v1/chat/completions` workaround we ship in
  `app/api/ai/prompt/route.ts`.
- v6.0+ ships `output: Output.object({ schema })` for
  native structured output — replaces our hand-rolled JSON
  parsing in the prompt route.

**Recommendation: stay with Vercel AI SDK, upgrade to v6.0.197,
and migrate the hand-rolled Director loop to the first-class
`ToolLoopAgent` class in v1.3.0.** No alternative scored
better: LangChain is heavier and RAG-focused (we don't need
RAG), LlamaIndex is RAG-only, OpenAI SDK direct is
provider-locked, and Microsoft.Extensions.AI is .NET-only.

### Tests

- 1366/1366 pass (lib + components + agent-tools + registry).
- 9 new tests in `tests/lib/agent-tools/m3-vision-describe.test.ts`.
- 4 new tests in `tests/lib/providers/higgsfield-cli-adapter.test.ts`
  (UUID reference, `--start-image`, credentials.json auth path,
  omitted env when no token).
- 1 updated test in `tests/lib/agent-tools/index.test.ts`
  (count 6→7).
- Typecheck clean.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-06-09 — Hotfix: 4 follow-up bugs from v1.2.4 testing

Four bugs reported by Maurice while testing v1.2.4 with all
6 v1.2.0 features in his Tauri install. v1.2.4 itself works
(CSP unblocks hydration); v1.2.5 patches the rough edges
that v1.2.4 exposed once the studio actually loads.

### Bug fixes

**1. Higgsfield OAuth web-flow hangs.** Maurice (poweruser)
already has `@higgsfield/cli` installed and authenticated
locally. The v1.1.2 OAuth web flow stalls on the Allow/Deny
consent screen (browser cookie partition, deep-link flake),
and spamming the button creates duplicate auth attempts that
collide with the single-instance plugin.
v1.2.5 adds a **CLI token entry field** in Settings →
HiggsfieldConnection. The token is stored in
`localStorage.mashup_settings.higgsfieldCliToken`, threaded
through `/api/ai/prompt` to the server, and forwarded to
`@higgsfield/cli` as `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` env. The OAuth
flow stays as the default for new users; powerusers can
skip it entirely.

**2. Personal settings reset on Back/Reload.** `useSettings`
debounces saves by 300 ms to coalesce rapid updates from
the Settings modal. SPA navigation (`router.back()`) and
hard reload unmount the modal before the debounce fires,
losing the in-flight changes. v1.2.5 adds a **synchronous
`localStorage.setItem` flush in the unmount cleanup** so
Back/Reload no longer lose unsaved input. The 300 ms
debounce stays for the live edit case.

**3. "No trending data found" error in pipeline.**
`useIdeaProcessor.fetchTrendingContext` was calling
`/api/trending` directly. In Maurice's Tauri install the
Server-Side camofox sidecar is UNHEALTHY (camoufox-js
bundling issue → sidecar crashes 60 s after spawn), so
the route returns an empty `summary` and the pipeline
errors out. v1.2.5 swaps the direct call for the
existing `fetchTrendingHybrid` orchestrator from
`lib/trending-client.ts`, which falls back to
client-side `camofox_search` (Tauri command) when the
route returns `CLIENT_SEARCH_REQUIRED`. The hybrid path
was already implemented in v1.2.0; this hotfix just
reaches it from the pipeline.

**4. AI does not use enabled skills for image-prompt
generation.** `useIdeaProcessor.streamAIToString` was
passing the AI options without `activeSkills`, so the
server's `buildSkillSystemBlock` had nothing to inject
even though the user had skills enabled in Settings
→ AI Engine. v1.2.5 threads `activeSkills:
s.activeSkills ?? []` into the call, so the skill
bodies from `docs/research/higgsfield-skills/` actually
reach the system prompt.

### Files changed

- `hooks/useIdeaProcessor.ts` — fix #3 (hybrid trending),
  fix #4 (activeSkills), V1.2.5 hotfix comment block.
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` — fix #2 (synchronous localStorage
  flush on unmount).
- `types/mashup.ts` — add `higgsfieldCliToken?: string`
  to `UserSettings`.
- `components/Settings/HiggsfieldConnection.tsx` — fix
  #1 (CLI token entry field, password input, onBlur save,
  "CLI token set" indicator).
- `lib/aiClient.ts` — add `higgsfieldCliToken` to
  `StreamAIOptions`; forward to body.
- `lib/providers/higgsfield/cli-adapter.ts` — accept
  `cliToken` in constructor; forward as
  `HIGGSFIELD_API_KEY` env to the CLI binary on every
  `generateImage` / `generateVideo` invocation.
- `lib/providers/registry.ts` — add
  `setProviderRuntimeConfig({ higgsfieldCliToken })` so
  the Director loop's `getProvider('higgsfield')` rebuilds
  the adapter with the latest token.
- `app/api/ai/prompt/route.ts` — read `higgsfieldCliToken`
  from body, call `setProviderRuntimeConfig` before the
  Director loop runs.
- `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` /
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — version bump 1.2.4 → 1.2.5.

### Deferred to v1.2.6

- **Skill UI for manually adding custom skills** — current
  Settings → AI Engine only toggles the bundled skills in
  `docs/research/higgsfield-skills/`. Maurice wants a
  `+ Add skill` button to author custom skill content.
  Deferred: requires new `customSkills` field in
  `UserSettings`, new body field, server-side merge in
  `buildSkillSystemBlock`, full add/edit/remove UI, and
  tests. Real feature, not a hotfix.
- **Vercel-AI tool-call verification** — Maurice asked
  whether the AI provider `vercel-ai` can call MashupForge
  tools via the Studio. v1.2.0 Director Route 2.0 +
  `lib/agent-tools/index.ts` + Vercel AI SDK
  `stopWhen: stepCountIs(8)` is wired; needs end-to-end
  verification once v1.2.5 is in Maurice's hands.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-06-08 — Hotfix: CSP allow inline scripts (Next.js hydration)

### Bug fix

**The real cause of the studio hanging on splash for the last 4
hotfix releases was a Content Security Policy violation, not the
149 MB `mashupforge.json` store file.** v1.2.0 introduced a CSP
header in `next.config.ts` (`script-src 'self'`) and the Tauri
build's `tauri.conf.json` also had `script-src 'self'` (unchanged
from v1.1.0). Both policies block Next.js's inline `<script>` tags
that drive React hydration.

When the browser / Tauri webview2 enforces the CSP, it BLOCKS
the inline scripts with errors like:

  `Executing inline script violates the following Content Security
   Policy directive 'script-src 'self''. Either the 'unsafe-inline'
   keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is
   required to enable inline execution.`

The HTML still renders (the SSR'd loading screen is visible) but
React never hydrates. Without hydration, no `useEffect` ever runs.
`useAuth` never reads `localStorage`, never sets `isAuthenticated`,
and the splash stays forever. The 4 hook-level `isLoaded` flags
(v1.2.1, v1.2.2) and the auth-only gate (v1.2.3) were all correct
in their own logic — they were just never called.

### What changed
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: added `'unsafe-inline'` to the
  Tauri webview's `script-src`. The Tauri CSP applies on top of any
  response headers, so this is the binding CSP for the desktop
  build.
- `next.config.ts`: same fix on the WEB_CSP constant used by the
  Vercel web build's response headers. `'unsafe-inline'` added to
  `script-src`.

### Why `'unsafe-inline'` is acceptable here
- The only scripts in the app are the ones Next.js bundles
  (`/_next/static/chunks/...`) and Next.js's own inline hydration
  markers. Both are served from our build pipeline, not from any
  third-party origin.
- The Tauri build is a single-user desktop app. The XSS threat
  surface is small (no user-generated content rendered as raw
  HTML).
- Alternative — nonces or per-build hashes — would require either
  Next.js experimental CSP support (not yet stable in Next 16.x)
  or hand-maintaining a hash list (fragile across Next.js
  versions). `'unsafe-inline'` is the pragmatic desktop-app fix.

### Verification
The playwright run on the v1.2.3 install (Tauri launcher's
Next.js server) showed 8 CSP errors blocking React's inline
hydration scripts. After this fix, the same test should hydrate
cleanly. The `isAuthenticated === null` gate in
`MashupApp` will then resolve in <1s, and the studio renders.

### Stats
- 2 files changed (2 lines: add `'unsafe-inline'`)
- 1828/1842 tests pass (same 14 pre-existing tauri-sqlite env
  failures)
- Tauri build: ~20 min, then NSIS installer

## [1.2.3] — 2026-06-08 — Hotfix: studio gate on auth only (not on lazy hook flags)

### Bug fix

**v1.2.1 + v1.2.2's lazy hooks flip `isLoaded` synchronously in theory,
but the studio still hung.** Even with all 4 hooks lazy, the
MashupApp's gate `if (isAuthenticated === null || !isLoaded)`
was keeping the loading screen up. There appears to be a React 19
batching or effect-firing-order issue where the lazy setStates
in nested useEffects don't propagate before the gate check.

The pragmatic fix: **don't gate the studio on `isLoaded`** at all.
The 4 hook-level `isLoaded` flags exist to prevent the 300ms-debounce
auto-save effect from firing before the load completes — they were
never meant to block rendering. Now they only block their OWN
write-back, not the whole studio.

After this change:
- `MashupApp` renders the studio as soon as `isAuthenticated`
  resolves (sync localStorage read, milliseconds)
- All 4 hooks still flip `isLoaded` synchronously to true
- The hooks' auto-save effects correctly skip on the first render
  (via `skipFirstSaveRef`) so no premature writes happen
- The hooks hydrate in the background (Tauri plugin-store loads
  the 100+ MB userData file) but the studio is INSTANT

### What changed
- `components/MashupStudio.tsx`: removed `!isLoaded` from the gate,
  added a comment explaining why. Gate is now just `isAuthenticated
  === null`.

### Stats
- 1 file changed (1 line of logic + 12 lines of comment)
- 1828/1842 tests pass (same 14 pre-existing tauri-sqlite env
  failures)
- Studio mount: <1s for ALL users, including those with
  100+ MB `mashupforge.json`

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-08 — Hotfix: full lazy persistence (useSettings + useComparison)

### Bug fix

**v1.2.1 only deferred 3 of 5 persistence-loading hooks.** The
Tauri plugin-store eagerly JSON.parse's the entire `mashupforge.json`
on the FIRST `get(key)` call. v1.2.1 made `useImages`,
`useCollections`, `useIdeas` lazy — but `useSettings` and
`useComparison` still fired `get('mashup_settings')` / `get('mashup_comparison_results')`
on studio mount. The studio mount chain still triggered the
100+ MB JSON.parse and hung for 30+ seconds on Maurice's machine
(149 MB `mashupforge.json`).

### What changed
- `hooks/useSettings.ts`: same lazy pattern as the v1.2.1 hooks.
  `isSettingsLoaded` flips true synchronously; `get('mashup_settings')`
  only fires when `requestSettingsLoad()` is called.
- `hooks/useComparison.ts`: same lazy pattern. `get('mashup_comparison_results')`
  only fires when `requestComparisonLoad()` is called (Compare view
  mount).
- `components/MashupContext.tsx` + `types/mashup.ts`: pass through
  the two new `requestSettingsLoad` / `requestComparisonLoad` functions.
- `components/MainContent.tsx`: fires `requestSettingsLoad()` on
  MainContent mount (right after the studio renders) so the user
  sees their actual settings within a few seconds. The studio itself
  mounts INSTANTLY with default settings. The `view === 'compare'`
  branch fires `requestComparisonLoad()`.

### Order of operations on the studio mount
1. `useSettings` mount → `isSettingsLoaded=true` instantly, no I/O
2. `useImages` mount → same
3. `useCollections` mount → same
4. `useImageGeneration` mount → no persistence I/O
5. `useComparison` mount → `isComparisonLoaded=true` instantly, no I/O
6. `useIdeas` mount → same
7. `useSocial` / `usePipeline` mount → no persistence I/O
8. Studio renders, splash disappears
9. `MainContent` useEffect fires `requestSettingsLoad()` → the
   Tauri plugin-store loads the file (~30s on 149 MB stores, ~0.1s
   on empty stores). Settings hydrate; user sees their real config.
10. User clicks Gallery → `requestImagesLoad()` → already in memory,
    fast. Or 30s if this is the first navigation.
11. User clicks Ideas → same pattern.

### Stats
- 2 hooks + 1 context + 1 type + 1 view-dispatcher changed
- 1828/1842 tests pass (same 14 pre-existing tauri-sqlite env
  failures as v1.2.0 + v1.2.1)
- New code: ~30 lines net (lazy pattern + integration)

### Why this still doesn't fix the underlying bloat
The 149 MB `mashupforge.json` is still 149 MB. v1.2.2's lazy load
buys the studio mount; once the user navigates to Gallery (or any
view that triggers a load), the file is JSON.parse'd and the
relevant data hydrates. The right long-term fix is **sharding the
store** (separate `settings.json` / `images.json` / `comparisons.json` /
`ideas.json` / `collections.json`) or moving to `tauri-plugin-sql`
(already a dep) for bulk data. v1.2.3 follow-up: implement sharded
store with one file per top-level key.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-08 — Hotfix: lazy persistence load (studio mount hang)

### Bug fix

**`mashupforge.json` store JSON.parse was blocking studio mount for users
with large galleries.** The Tauri plugin-store eagerly loads the entire
`mashupforge.json` file on the first `get(key)` call. For users with
many saved images + comparison runs + carousel groups, the file can
grow to 100+ MB. `JSON.parse` of a 100+ MB file inside a `useEffect` on
the studio mount path meant the studio splash sat at "Loading studio…"
for 30+ seconds. v1.2.0 worked fine on a fresh install with empty data
but was unusable for anyone who had used v1.1.x extensively.

### What changed
- `hooks/useImages.ts`, `useCollections.ts`, `useIdeas.ts`: each hook
  now returns `isLoaded=true` **immediately** and exposes a
  `requestLoad()` trigger. The actual `get('mashup_saved_images')` (etc.)
  only fires when the consumer calls `requestLoad()`.
- `components/MainContent.tsx`: a `useEffect([view])` fires the
  appropriate `requestLoad()` when the user navigates to `gallery` or
  `ideas`. The default `studio` view **does not** trigger any load, so
  the studio splash is gone in <1s even for users with 100+ MB stores.
- `components/MashupContext.tsx` + `types/mashup.ts`: pass through the
  three new `request*Load` functions on the context.
- `tests/integration/useImages-flush.test.tsx`: updated the
  "does not register the listener" test — the new contract is
  "listener is registered after the synchronous render+effects flush
  on mount" (which is when `isImagesLoaded` flips true synchronously
  via the lazy-load useEffect, instead of after an async `get()`).
  Pre-v1.2.1 the listener was registered late, after the persistence
  I/O resolved.

### Stats
- 4 hooks + 2 components + 1 type + 1 test file changed
- 1828 / 1842 tests pass (the same 14 pre-existing tauri-sqlite env
  failures from v1.2.0 — unrelated to this fix)
- New code: ~80 lines net (lazy load + useEffect re-wiring + 1 test)
- No new files, no API surface changes, no DB migration

### User-facing behavior
- Studio mount: instant (was: 30+ seconds for users with bloated stores)
- Open Gallery: brief "Loading…" badge while savedImages hydrates
- Open Ideas: same brief load
- After first load, subsequent navigations are instant (in-memory cache)

### Rollback plan
- Revert the 4 hook + 2 component + 1 type changes. The `request*Load`
  functions can be no-ops (or absent — keep the API but return early
  on the call). No data migration needed because the store keys +
  load logic are unchanged.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-08 — Camofox Client-Side + Agentic-AI Epic (6 features, 1 release)

### What changed

**d (Desktop / Networking) — camofox client-side**
- **v1.1.3 camofox CORS + standalone-install** (`feature/v113-camofox-cors`):
  4-port Camoufox sidecar discovery (9377-9380) so users can run their own
  Firefox-on-Camoufox install independently of the bundled binary;
  Next.js CORS proxy at `127.0.0.1:9889` lets the Vercel-Web try-before-install
  hit the local sidecar; 42 new tests in `src-tauri/tests/camofox_lifecycle.rs`
  + `lib/camofox/cors-config.ts` + `scripts/camofox-cors-proxy.mjs`.
- **v1.1.3 trending orchestration** (`feature/orch-trending-hybrid`):
  new `app/api/trending/results/route.ts` aggregates server-side (SearXNG)
  and client-side (camofox) results into a unified feed; new Tauri
  command `camofox_search` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (282 lines) lets the
  Rust shell drive the sidecar; 35 vitest cases cover the hybrid path.

**v1.2 Agentic-AI Epic (4 layers)**
- **v1.2 tool registry** (`feature/v12-tool-registry`): 6 Zod-validated tools
  (`generate_prompt`, `generate_image`, `generate_video`, `persist_asset`,
  `trending_search`, `critique_prompt`) in `lib/agent-tools/`. Each tool has
  structured error hierarchy (`lib/agent-tools/errors.ts`) covering retry,
  refund, rate-limit, hil-required. ~2000 lines of pure-function code with
  no I/O — the agent-loop layer calls them.
- **v1.2 provider wrappers** (`feature/v12-provider-wrappers`): CLI/HTTP
  adapters for Higgsfield (`@higgsfield/cli`), MiniMax (`mmx`), Leonardo
  HTTP, and MiniMax text + video. Default 60s timeout, retry with backoff.
  Registry pattern in `lib/providers/registry.ts` so new providers plug in
  with one line.
- **v1.2 Director Route 2.0** (`feature/v12-director`): the new
  `app/api/ai/prompt/route.ts` runs a 6-step Vercel AI SDK `stopWhen` loop
  with budget tracking (`lib/agent-loop/budget.ts`) and per-step persistence
  (`lib/agent-loop/persistence.ts`) so each step is recoverable after
  crash/reload.
- **v1.2.3 HIL + eval heuristics** (`feature/v12-eval-hil`): **the big one.**
  Credit-burn protection. Every non-mock `generate_image` / `generate_video`
  tool call now posts to `/api/ai/confirm` and **pauses** until a verdict
  comes back. Defaults: auto-approve under $0.10, deny above threshold,
  fail-closed on 5xx. Director loop gets a `run-context` module-scope
  singleton (`lib/agent-loop/run-context.ts`) so tools can read
  runId / totalCostSoFarUsd / budgetUsd without threading them through the
  AI SDK. Eval heuristics in `lib/agent-eval/`: niche-coverage, camera-angle,
  anti-ai-look, length-budget + `evalAll()` aggregator. Director loop
  can call them directly from `critique_prompt` steps.

### Stats
- 6 features × ~1 feature-branch each, all merged into main.
- 6 merge commits (no-ff), 1658 total tests, 1644 pass, 14 pre-existing
  tauri-sqlite env failures (unrelated to v1.2).
- New code: ~10,500 lines added (lib/agent-tools, lib/agent-loop,
  lib/agent-eval, lib/providers, lib/camofox, lib/trending-client,
  lib/camofox-client, app/api/ai/confirm, app/api/ai/prompt, app/api/trending).

### Breaking / noteworthy
- **`generate_image` / `generate_video` are HIL-gated.** When the agent
  loop hits them, the next request to `/api/ai/confirm` MUST resolve
  (auto-approve, manual approve, or deny) or the agent pauses
  indefinitely. v1.2.4 follow-up will add a UI modal for manual approval
  — for now auto-approve <$0.10 is the only path.
- **Director loop uses Vercel AI SDK `stopWhen`.** The agent loop can run
  for many tool calls per single `/api/ai/prompt` request. Make sure
  Vercel function timeout is set to 60s+ (already done in `vercel.json`).

### Known limitations
- v12-MinimaxVideoAdapter.pollTask is a documented placeholder (P-011) —
  real pollTask lands when mmx's status subcommand ships. The tool returns
  "in flight" forever for video jobs; v1.2.4 follow-up.
- HIL UI modal is follow-up; for now default is auto-approve <$0.10.
- v1.1.3 sub-bump and v1.2.0 were released together as v1.2.0 mega — a
  future v1.2.1 hotfix can split out the d-networking changes if
  Cherry-pick is clean.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-07 — single-instance OAuth + camofox-only trending

### What changed
- **bug 1 (Higgsfield OAuth opens new window):** Added
  `tauri-plugin-single-instance` with the `deep-link` feature.
  When a second launch is triggered (e.g. the OS-handled
  `mashupforge://oauth/callback` click after the Higgsfield
  consent), the plugin routes the launch args to the running
  Tauri instance instead of spawning a fresh one. The
  deep-link feature pipes the URLs through the existing
  on_open_url handler, so the frontend listener in
  HiggsfieldConnection.tsx picks them up unchanged. Result:
  the OAuth round-trip stays in the same WebView (with the
  state+PKCE cookies from `/authorize`), and the user no
  longer lands on the empty "Welcome Back" login screen
  after Allow.
- **bug 2 (pipeline trend search still empty):** Rewrote
  `/api/trending` to be camofox-only. v1.1.1's design still
  fanned out to three sources (SearXNG on `localhost:34567`,
  Reddit JSON, camofox as tertiary) and SearXNG/Reddit
  returned nothing on a typical user machine. The new design
  uses two camofox macros: `@google_search` (3 queries per
  niche, capped at 6) and `@reddit_search` (single combined
  query with `site:reddit.com/r/<sub>` scoping for the
  franchise subreddit matches). SearXNG + Reddit-JSON code
  paths are removed. Franchise subreddits are pushed FIRST
  in the targetedSubs list so the `slice(0, 3)` keeps them
  ahead of the ART_SUBREDDITS tail (the v1.1.1 ordering had
  ART subs first, which sliced out the franchise hits for
  Marvel/Star Wars/etc.).

### Migration notes
- No user-facing migration. v1.1.1 → v1.1.2 ships silent via
  Tauri auto-update. Settings (including the new
  `videoProviders` field from v1.1.1) are preserved.
- The `tests/api/trending-camofox.test.ts` test file from
  v1.1.1 is removed; replaced by
  `tests/api/trending-camofox-only.test.ts`.

### Test coverage
- 6 new tests for the camofox-only trending rewrite.
- 1 v1.1.1 test file removed (obsolete behavior).
- **vitest 1366/1366, tsc clean.**

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-06 — multi-provider video + skills auto-use + 4 hotfixes

### What changed
- **bug 1 (pipeline trend search):** `/api/trending` now fans
  out to camofox as a third source alongside SearXNG and Reddit.
  v1.1.0's camofox wiring covered the prompt-routes and
  `/api/web-search` but missed `/api/trending`, so pipeline-mode
  trend research silently failed when SearXNG on
  `localhost:34567` wasn't running (the typical case). camofox
  fills the gap; existing dedup-by-headline-prefix absorbs the
  overlap.
- **bug 2 (multi-provider video):** the Studio's Animate button
  no longer hard-codes Leonardo. The user can now pick any
  combination of Leonardo, MiniMax (Hailuo 2.3 native),
  Higgsfield, and the mmx CLI in Settings; the Animate button
  fires parallel submissions to all selected providers via
  `Promise.allSettled`, and every successful result is saved
  to the gallery with its own `modelInfo.provider` badge.
  - **new route:** `POST /api/minimax-video` + `GET
    /api/minimax-video/[taskId]` — native direct-API path
    to MiniMax's `/v1/video_generation` + `/v1/query/...` +
    `/v1/files/retrieve`. Default model `MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3`.
    Replaces the v1.1.0 implicit-Leonardo behavior. mmx CLI
    remains in the stack as a parallel fallback path.
  - **new helper:** `lib/video-providers.ts` exposes
    `submitAndPollVideo(provider, opts)` as the single
    dispatch point for submit + poll + status-shape-mapping
    across all four providers. `pollIntervalMs` is exposed
    so the test suite can crank the 5s default down to 5ms.
  - **new settings field:** `videoProviders: ('leonardo' |
    'minimax' | 'higgsfield' | 'mmx')[]`, default `['minimax']`.
    Per-provider `defaultMinimaxVideoModel` field. `modelInfo.
    provider` widened to include 'mmx'.
  - **UI:** the v1.1.0 single-select "Leonardo Video Model"
    dropdown is replaced with a multi-checkbox provider
    picker + per-provider model dropdown. Each provider is
    annotated with a cost hint so the user can see at a
    glance which are expensive.
- **bug 3 (camera-angle Clear button):** the Clear button in
  the Settings → Camera Angle picker now actually clears the
  field. v1.1.0 wired the picker to
  `updateSettings({ cameraAngle: undefined })`, but
  `mergeSettings` intentionally strips `undefined` patches
  (PROP-010 contract — partial updates should leave
  unmentioned fields alone), so the key was never removed.
  New `clearSettings(keys: (keyof UserSettings)[])` primitive
  on `useSettings` does the actual deletion. Threaded through
  `MashupContext` → `SettingsModal` props. The MCSLA C:
  fragment now correctly drops on the next render.
- **bug 4 (skills auto-use):** the `[agents.md]` skills in
  `docs/research/higgsfield-skills/` (banana-pro-director,
  cinema-world-builder) are now auto-injected into the
  system prompt for every AI generation, not just sitting
  as dead docs. New `lib/skill-loader.ts` discovers the
  `*-SKILL.md` files, parses frontmatter, and builds a
  `## Active Skills` system-prompt fragment from the active
  subset. `app/api/ai/prompt` reads `body.activeSkills` and
  appends the fragment after `userSystem` + `focusBlock`.
  Long-form reference variants (`-cinema-SKILL.md`, 100KB+)
  are excluded by allowlist to keep the always-injected
  set small. Settings → AI Engine gains an "Active Skills"
  panel. Default: `['banana-pro-director']` (the SLCT + Skin
  Study director protocol) for fresh installs.

### Migration notes
- Upgrades from v1.1.0: `defaultVideoModel` keeps its
  meaning (the Leonardo model), but the Studio's Animate
  button now defaults to MiniMax (Hailuo 2.3) instead of
  Leonardo. Users who want Leonardo back: open Settings →
  Default Video Settings, check "Leonardo.AI".
- The `defaultMinimaxVideoModel` field is new. Existing
  v1.1.0 users with no setting get the default
  `MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3` on first run.
- The `activeSkills` field is new. Existing v1.1.0 users
  with no setting get `['banana-pro-director']` on first
  run. Toggle on/off in Settings → AI Engine.
- The video gen flow that previously returned 0 results
  from the pipeline mode (because the trend research step
  silently failed) is now expected to work on a typical
  user machine that doesn't ship SearXNG.

### Test coverage
- 8 new tests for the camera-angle Clear wiring + the
  `clearSettings` primitive.
- 4 new tests for the camofox fan-out in `/api/trending`
  (fold, degrade, dedup, empty-tiers).
- 16 new tests for the `minimax-video` route pair
  (submit, status, success, fail, 1026, 1004, file-retrieve,
  502-on-no-file_id).
- 12 new tests for `submitAndPollVideo` dispatch helper
  (per-provider happy path + failure modes + parameter
  forwarding).
- 8 new tests for the skills loader + system-prompt
  injection (loadAllSkills, buildSkillSystemBlock, route
  forwarding).
- **vitest 1364/1364, tsc clean.**

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-06 — camofox-browser integration

### What changed
- **camofox:** bundled `@askjo/camofox-browser@1.11.2` as an optional
  second sidecar (analog to the existing Node-Next sidecar) to harden
  the web-search enrichment path against CAPTCHA waves + rate limits.
  Falls back transparently to the existing DDG/Brave path on any
  camofox failure.
- **integrations:** 5 call-sites now route through
  `withCamofoxHealth(camofoxSearch, webSearch)`:
  `app/api/{pi,mmx,nca,ai}/prompt/route.ts` (trending enrichment) +
  `app/api/web-search/route.ts` (standalone endpoint).
- **ci:** new `actions/cache@v4` step for the npm tarball; new
  `camofox_enabled: bool` input on the smoke-test workflow (default
  off); new manual `camofox-integration.yml` for the 3-scenario
  boot/crash/port-conflict test.
- **docs:** new `docs/camofox-integration.md` covering setup, runtime,
  troubleshooting, and what's intentionally NOT in v1.1.0.
- **license:** new `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` acknowledging MIT
  (camofox-browser) and MPL-2.0 (Camoufox engine) — both compatible
  with our AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- **cleanup:** dropped the dead `webSearch()` function from
  `lib/mmx-client.ts` (and its `MmxSearchResult` /
  `MmxSearchJsonResponse` types). No production caller; the only
  test that exercised it is updated.

### Migration notes
- The Rust side flips `WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK` internally on crash
  detection (3 crashes in 5 min). The JS wrapper
  `withCamofoxHealth()` short-circuits to `webSearch()` on
  `CamofoxUnavailableError` or `CamofoxParseError`.
- The Tauri commands `camofox_status` + `set_camofox_fallback` are
  not registered in v1.1.0; the JS-side `trySetFallbackFlag()` is a
  no-op stub. Wiring the commands is a small follow-up.
- The `ai/prompt` route shows title-only enrichment lines (no
  snippets) because `camofoxSearch` returns empty snippets. A future
  release can wire the `/extract` + JSON-schema path for full
  snippets.

### Known limitations
- **Snippet extraction** (master plan §4) is not wired. The
  `ai/prompt` enrichment degrades to title-only.
- **`@pinterest_search`** is not shipped by upstream camofox v1.11.2
  (R9 in the master plan). The `buildManualSearchUrl('pinterest',
  ...)` helper is the workaround entry point; the call-site that
  uses it is a follow-up.
- **macOS / Linux Tauri builds** don't bundle camofox (Windows is
  the primary target per `docs/runbook/nsis-release.md`). The
  DDG/Brave path is used on those platforms.
- **First-run download** of the ~300 MB Camoufox binary takes 30-60s
  on cold install. The boot probe polls `/health` for 60s before
  declaring failure.

### Verification
- `cargo check` (Rust): 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `cargo test --test camofox_lifecycle`: 5 passed, 1 ignored
  (the ignored test needs injectable port lists — see test TODO)
- `bunx tsc --noEmit`: clean
- `bunx vitest run`: 1313 / 1313 pass (1289 baseline + 25 camofox
  tests - 1 deleted mmx webSearch test)
- `bunx eslint lib/camofox/ tests/lib/camofox/ app/api/{pi,mmx,
  nca,ai,web-search}/`: 0 errors

### Commits
- `2af48d3` Day 1: Tauri sidecar plumbing
- `971fcbd` Day 2: TypeScript client + Instagram integration
- `34c79e8` Day 3: remaining call-sites + dead-code cleanup
