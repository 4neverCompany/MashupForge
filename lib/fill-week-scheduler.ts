// V060-004: fill-week-first slot picker.
//
// The pipeline used to call findBestSlot with the default 14-day window
// for every new post, so the engagement-best slot from week 2 (often
// Saturday evening) could outrank lower-engagement slots in the current
// week — leaving holes in this week while next week filled up first.
//
// pickFillWeekSlot caps the candidate horizon at 7 days while the
// current week still has gaps (per `computeWeekFillStatus`), then
// extends to 14 days once week 1 is filled. The engagement-based
// scoring inside findBestSlot is unchanged — this helper only narrows
// the window.
//
// Pure: pass `now` so tests can pin the clock.

  // findBestSlot, not just an input to computeWeekFillStatus. The soft
  // dispersion penalty inside findBestSlots (`score / (1 + dayCount)`)
  // wasn't enough to stop a dominant engagement day from absorbing every
  // pipeline post — Saturday 20:00 at raw=20 still beat Monday 12:00 at
  // raw=2.4 even after 5 Saturday posts (20/6=3.3 > 2.4/1). The hard cap
  // forces the picker to bounce off a full day and land on the next
  // engagement-best day instead.
  // AUTO-SCHEDULE-DEPTH-FIRST (2026-05-22): pipeline path uses depth-first
  // fill — each day fills its heatmap-ordered hours up to postsPerDay
  // before spilling to the next day. Previously findBestSlots' soft
  // score-max picker spread one post per day across days at each day's
  // peak hour, producing Maurice's "12 posts all at 19:00" cluster
  // across 12 different days.
