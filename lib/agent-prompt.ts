/**
 * V080-DES-003 — single source of truth for the default agent system
 * prompt, parameterised by the user's selected niches and genres.
 *
 * Why this lives in lib/: SettingsModal's "Reset to Default" button
 * used to write a hardcoded paragraph that named "Marvel, DC, Star
 * Wars, Warhammer 40k" regardless of what the user had picked. Pulling
 * the prompt builder out of the component lets us interpolate the
 * actual selections (or fall back to the curated defaults if the user
 * has cleared everything) and keeps the same template usable from
 * anywhere else that needs to seed a fresh agent (onboarding, tests).
 *
 * The runtime call sites (useImageGeneration, usePipelineDaemon,
 * useIdeaProcessor) already append the LIVE niches/genres to whatever
 * `agentPrompt` contains at request time, so this template is the
 * "personality" baseline — the focus tags it lists set the agent's
 * default frame, and the live tag list overrides on every call.

 *
 * Settings labels migrated in lockstep: "Platform Niches" →
 * "Content Pillars", "Target Genres" → "Style Tags". The underlying
 * settings keys (agentNiches, agentGenres) are unchanged so existing
 * user data survives — only display vocabulary shifts.
