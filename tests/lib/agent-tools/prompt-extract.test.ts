/**
 * V1.7.0-PRE-PROD-FIX: tests for `extractDraftFromCommentary` and
 * `trimCommentarySuffix`. The previous `cleanModelOutput` only
 * stripped <think> blocks and markdown fences, so the model's
 * commentary around the actual prompt leaked into the image prompt
 * verbatim. See lib/agent-tools/prompt-extract.ts for the helper.
 *
 * We test the helper directly (not through the Vercel AI SDK) so
 * each case is fast and the failure messages are precise.
