/**
 * M3.1 (V1.8): identity-stable event-callback helpers.
 *
 * The render-perf problem: MashupContext's value object — and most
 * handler props below it — were re-created on every provider render,
 * so `React.memo` on expensive children (GalleryCard) could never
 * bail out and every pipeline tick re-rendered the whole tree.
 * Stabilizing every source hook with `useCallback` would mean
 * threading exhaustive dep lists through ~7 large hooks; instead we
 * stabilize at the boundary with the classic "useEvent" pattern: a
 * ref always holds the LATEST implementation, while the function
 * identity handed out never changes.
 *
 * Semantics (same as React's experimental `useEffectEvent` /
 * ahooks' `useMemoizedFn`):
 *   - The returned function is referentially stable for the lifetime
 *     of the component.
 *   - Calling it invokes the implementation from the most recent
 *     committed render (no stale closures).
 *   - NOT for functions called during render — event handlers,
 *     effects, and async flows only. (A render-phase call could
 *     observe the previous render's implementation.)

 * Stable-identity wrapper for a single callback. The wrapper always
 * dispatches to the latest implementation.
 *
 * Implementation note: the stable identity comes from a `useState`
 * lazy initializer (runs exactly once, identity guaranteed for the
 * component's lifetime) rather than `useCallback([])` — the repo's
 * react-hooks lint config forbids both non-inline useCallback args
 * and ref reads during render, and useMemo's cache is allowed to be
 * discarded by React, which would break the identity GUARANTEE this
 * module exists to provide. The wrapper only dereferences the ref at
 * call time (event/effect phase), never during render.
